# 🔍 Custom Search Engine System

A lightweight and scalable custom search engine built from scratch to index and search documents using ranking algorithms, tokenization, and query processing techniques. Designed for efficient search performance across structured or unstructured data.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Text data indexing and tokenization
- ✅ Inverted index for fast lookup
- ✅ TF-IDF / BM25-based ranking (optional enhancements)
- ✅ Boolean, phrase, and fuzzy search support
- ✅ Modular architecture (easy to plug in custom ranking or parsing)
- ✅ Clean CLI or API interface for queries
- ✅ Scalable to large document sets

## 🧪 Sample Usage

### 🔹 1. Index Documents

```bash
python main.py index --data ./data/

This command reads all .txt or .json documents in the data/ folder, tokenizes them, and builds an inverted index stored in index.json.
🔹 2. Perform a Search

python main.py search "road damage detection"

Returns a ranked list of documents containing the keywords.
🧠 Supported Search Types

    Keyword Search: machine learning

    Boolean Search: deep AND learning

    Phrase Search: "road damage"

    Wildcard/Fuzzy Search (optional): detect*

📈 Future Enhancements

Add a Flask/React UI

Synonym and stemming support

Realtime indexing

    Support for PDF/HTML parsing
